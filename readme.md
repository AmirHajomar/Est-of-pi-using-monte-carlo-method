This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of π using random sampling and geometric probability.
By uniformly generating points inside a unit square and measuring the fraction that fall within a quarter circle, the algorithm approximates π through statistical convergence rather than deterministic formulas.
The project is designed to demonstrate probabilistic modeling, simulation-based estimation, and convergence analysis — all core techniques used in quantitative finance and computational physics. 
In addition to computing an estimate of π, the program visualizes convergence behavior and analyzes error as the number of samples increases.
